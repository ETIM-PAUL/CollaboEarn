# CollaboEarn

**CollaboEarn** is a collaborative content creation platform where **writers, illustrators, video creators**, web3 community and **fans** co-create interactive content around admin-created themes. Each contribution to a theme earns royalties from user tips, making collaboration both creative and rewarding.

Contributions (words, artworks, clips) are all stored on IPFS (and then the ipfs uri is stored onchain) helping reduce the size of the stored data onchain.

## Key Features

- **Admin-driven Themes**  
  Admins can create themed prompts (e.g. *"Future of AI"*) that support:
  - **Articles** (words)
  - **Artworks**
  - **Videos**

- **Collaborative Content Creation**  
  Contributors can submit original works under any theme. All submissions require **admin approval** to be visible and eligible for tips.

  Each Theme has  a maximum number of collaborations and doesn't allow more than the number.

- **Tip & Earn**  
  Viewers can **tip any contribution**. The tip amount is equally distributed as royalties to **all approved collaborators** of such theme.

- **Royalty Distribution**  
  Tips are split among contributors automatically via smart contract.
